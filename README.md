# Text Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a step-by-step implementation of text classification,
starting from basic machine learning models and gradually moving
towards deep learning approaches.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to classify a given piece of text into predefined categories
using machine learning and deep learning models.

## Learning Objective
- Understand text preprocessing
- Learn how text is converted into numerical form
- Compare traditional ML and deep learning models
